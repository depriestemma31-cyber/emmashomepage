    <h1>Reflection for Chapters 1-3 </h1>
    <p>For the first reflection, I read chapters 1-3 of The Psychology of the Web Developer,  Reality of a Female Freelancer by Maisa Imamovic. The first few chapters reflect on Imamovic's early encounters  with language, migration, and the internet. She talks about how she used a software called Spleck to learn English, but she also encountered a humanistic relationship with the chatbot. After a while of using this, she started to realize the flaws of the software as it repeated meaningless questions to hers. She describes how that shaped her identity and understanding of digital spaces. In the next few chapters, titled Assistant Web Developer and The Web Developer, she discusses psychological pressures associated with web developing. From the perspectives of Larry and Scott, readers see Larry's intensive thought process behind building a website. These 2 chapters also  highlight how seemingly simple websites have intense labor and complex systems behind them.</p>
