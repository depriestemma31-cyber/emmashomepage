<h3>Reflection 1: Chapters 1-3 of The Psychology of the Web Developer </h3>
    <p> For the first reflecion, I read chapters 1-3 of The Psychology of the Web Developer, Reality of a Female Freelancer by Maisa Imamovic. The first few chapters reflect on Imamovic's early encounters with language, migration, and the internet. She describes how that shaped her identity and understanding of digital spaces. In the next few chapters, titled Assistant Web Developer and The Web Developer, she discusses psychological pressures associated with web developing. These 2 chapters also highlight how seemingly simple websites have intense labor and complex systems behind them.</p>
