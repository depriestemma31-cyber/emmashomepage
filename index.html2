    <h3>Reflection 1: Chapters 1-3 of The Psychology of the Web Developer </h3>
    <p> For the first reflecion, I read chapters 1-3 of The Psychology of the Web Developer,
     Reality of a Female Freelancer by Maisa Imamovic. The first few chapters reflect on Imamovic's early encounters 
     with language, migration, and the internet. She talks about how she used a software called Spleck to learn english, 
     but she also encountered a humanistic relationship with the chatbot. After a while of using this, she started to 
     realize the flaws of the software as it repeated meaningless questions to hers. She describes how that shaped her 
     identity and understanding of digital spaces. In the next few chapters, titled Assistant Web Developer and The Web 
     Developer, she discusses psychological pressures associated with web developing. From the perspectives of Larry and 
     Scott, readers see Larry's intensive thought process behind building a website.These 2 chapters also 
     highlight how seemingly simple websites have intense labor and complex systems behind them.</p>
